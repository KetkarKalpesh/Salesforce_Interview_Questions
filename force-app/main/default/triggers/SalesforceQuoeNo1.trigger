/*
Problem Statement:- 
In our Salesforce org, we need to ensure that a Vehicle's (parent) insurance status accurately reflects 
its most recent Insurance (child) record. Each Insurance record has an 'IsActive' flag and an 'InsuranceNumber'. 
The challenge is to update the Vehicleâ€™s 'IsInsured' field only when a new Insurance record with the highest 'InsuranceNumber' among all related records is inserted. 
Must use helper, handler classes for best practice!
(Note: - Insurance records with same 'InsuranceNumber' can't be inserted under respective Vehicle parent record)

trigger SalesforceQuoeNo1 on Insurance__c (after insert) {
    if (Trigger.isAfter && Trigger.isInsert) {
        SalesforceQuoeNo1Handler.handleAfterInsert(Trigger.new);
    }
}
